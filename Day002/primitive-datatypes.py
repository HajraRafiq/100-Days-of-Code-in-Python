# Data Types



#  1. String (Characters datatype and you can extract each character indivisually by index)

print("Hello"[1])  #it will print 2nd character of the string because the index starts from 0

# 2. Integer (Numbers without decimal points)

print(123+345) # It will simply add them 
print (int(123.5)) #It will just print the numbers before decimal points
print("123" + "345") # now its in qoute so they will be treated as strings and will concatenate the numbers as 123345

# 3. Float - Floating point numbers (Numbers with decimal points)

print(float(3.12)) # It will print the complete number with decimal point

# 4. Boolean (True / False)
