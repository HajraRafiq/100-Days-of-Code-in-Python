# variables are used to store data
# you can use variables to get the data later on
# variable names should be meaningful
# dont use spaces between variable names e.g var name instead you can use var_name
# dont use numbers in the start of variable names e.g 3var ,12var etc instead you can type var3

print(name)

name = "Hajraaaa"
print(name)
# to check the length of the string
length= len(name)
